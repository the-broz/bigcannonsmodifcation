# Info for translating Create Big Cannons

To start translating Create Big Cannons, fork the repository. On Github, you can do this by clicking the "Fork" button as shown here:
![Fork Repository Button](https://i.imgur.com/kpTAgOy.png "The button is greyed out because I cannot and do not need to fork for myself as I own the repository. However, you can click this button.")

After you have forked the repository, there are two ways you can translate the mod:

If your language already has an associated lang file [here](/src/main/resources/assets/createbigcannons/lang), edit that one if you feel like additions or improvements should be made. Edit the lang file in-place.

If your language does *not* have an associated lang file in the previously mentioned directory, obtain a template lang file from [`src/generated/resources/assets/createbigcannons/lang/en_us.json`](src/generated/resources/assets/createbigcannons/lang/en_us.json). However, *DO NOT* place your translated lang file in `src/generated/resources`! It will be overwritten by data generation. Instead, place your translated lang file in [`src/main/resources/assets/createbigcannons/lang`](/src/main/resources/assets/createbigcannons/lang).

Once you have finished translation, open up a pull request on the main repository (`rbasamoyai/CreateBigCannons`, *not* your repository!) and request a merge with the main repository. To open a pull request, click the button in the `Pull Requests` tab as shown below:
![New Pull Request](https://i.imgur.com/gzMY7bF.png)

On opening a pull request, switch the branch in the highlighted tab to your repository.
![Merge Forked Branch](https://i.imgur.com/9LPp8ko.png "Again, since I do not have any forks I am not presented with the opportunity to merge a fork, but since you can, it should present a list of things you can submit for a pull request.")

*Read more on making pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)*.

And you are done! Contributions made will have to be reviewed, so sit tight. It should not take long.

That's all there is to translating the mod. Have fun, and happy translating!
